#>A basic algorithm for solving p01_bubble_sort<

1. Create the list of items
2. Create a method to store the size of the list
3. Create a method to track if the list is sorted
4. Create a method to track the position in the list
5. Read the list
6. Set the position to the start (first item) of the list
7. Set the list to sorted 
8. Compare the current item with the next item
  a. If a swap is performed set the list to unsorted
9. Check if the end of the list has been reached
10. Check if the list is sorted
  a. If it is sorted go to step 11
  b. If it is not sorted go back to step 6
11. Print the sorted list to the screen
