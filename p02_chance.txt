#>Using random numbers<

**** You will need either chance.cpp or chance.py for this problem.  ****

PROBLEM

Random numbers are used for all kinds of problems.  For this particular homework you will be modifying
the provided program to solve a couple of problems.  The random number generator has been provided, but
you will need to modify it to provide acceptable output.  Do not use functions like range() to 
solve the problem.  Try and do it the hard way.

PROBLEM 1 - CHANGE IT
Just a warm up to get familiar with the random generator.  Modify the program to give a guess on the
amount of change you will get back.  This means all output is 0-100. 

PROBLEM 2 - DICE GAME
Probably the simplest use of random numbers. Modify the program to produce dice rolls for a six sided die.
That means all output should be 1-6.

PROBLEM 3 - WEIGHT GAME
Modify the program to guess a persons weight.  Make the output realistic.

HINTS

The generator takes a low and high parameter.  What could they be used for?
To limit the size of the number you may want to use a property of division.

EXTRA CREDIT

PROBLEM 2 - ADVANCED
Try and build a dice game that uses the results. (RISK, YAHTZEE, FARKLE)

PROBLEM 3 - ADVANCED
Try and build a carnival game that takes the users height and age, and guesses within +/- 10 pounds.

PROBLEM 4 - HIGH/LOW
Try and build a game that stores 6 numbers.  The user then guesses if the next number is higher or lower.
