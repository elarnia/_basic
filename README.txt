#>Simple programming problems and solutions<

This repository is used to pose basic programming problems for those trying to learn programming.
"Homework" will be posted in a .txt file.
Solutions will be posted in both a .cpp and .py format a few days later.
Multiple solutions may be posted to demonstrate OOP ideas.

NO SOLUTION CODE PROVIDED SHOULD BE USED FOR ACTUAL HOMEWORK!

Feel free to run the solution code and verify it actually works.
Error testing is one of the most important steps to writing good programs.
You should try and test as many cases as possible to see what happens.
This will help with writing better, "bug" free programs.
